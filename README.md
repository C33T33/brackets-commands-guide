Brackets Command Finder
=======================
An extension for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/), a new open-source code editor for the web.

_**Note:** This extension requires a bleeding-edge build of Brackets for now, since it requires commit [bb47a15](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/commit/bb47a15e44e71d38df39c41c00f3b93623704620).
The current Sprint 12 ZIP download will not work._

Use the keyboard to quickly search for commands and run them:

1. Press Cmd+Alt+? (Ctrl+Alt+? on Win)
2. Start typing (part of) the name of a command
3. Use arrow keys to select the one you want (if you've filtered the list down to just one command, this isn't needed)
4. Press Enter to run it

If you've ever used Quicksilver on Mac, or Sublime's Command Palette, or Eclipse's Quick Access (Ctrl+3) -- this is the same deal.

Note that the list may include some commands you can't find anywhere in the menus -- some commands in Brackets are available only via keyboard shortcuts.


How to Install
==============
To use Brackets Command Finder:

1. [Download the ZIP](https://github.com/peterflynn/brackets-command-finder/downloads) and unzip it; or clone this repo on GitHub
