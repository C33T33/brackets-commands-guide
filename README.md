Brackets Commands Guide
=======================
An extension for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/), a new open-source code editor for the web.

_**Note:** This extension requires Brackets Sprint 14 or newer._

Use the keyboard to quickly search for commands and run them:

1. Press Cmd+Alt+? (Ctrl+Alt+? on Win)
2. Start typing (part of) the name of a command
3. Use arrow keys to select the one you want (or skip this to use the topmost result)
4. Press Enter to run it

If you've ever used Quicksilver on Mac, or Sublime's Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), or Eclipse's Quick Access (Ctrl+3) -- this is the same deal.

Note that the list may include some commands you can't find anywhere in the menus -- some commands in Brackets are available only via keyboard shortcuts.
